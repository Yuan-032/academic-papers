## Economics Capstone  

**Title:** The Causal Effect of Retirement on Health Condition: An Empirical Study in China  
**Type:** Economics capstone project  
**Paper:** [`Yuan_Huang_Econ_capstone.pdf`](Yuan_Huang_Econ_capstone.pdf)  

**Summary:**  
Empirical study of how retirement affects health outcomes among older adults in China, using China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data and regression discontinuity designs to separate retirement effects from age and cohort trends.

## Data Science Capstone  

**Title:** User Intention Detection and Evaluation for Recommendation Systems  
**Type:** Computer Science & Data Science capstone project  
**Paper:** [`Intention_recommendation_Capstone_Reports.pdf`](Intention_recommendation_Capstone_Reports.pdf)  

**Summary:**  
Develops an intention-aware recall metric for recommendation systems using the MovieLens 1M dataset. Extracts user intentions from interaction data and compares multiple recommendation models, showing that the new metric captures aspects of user intention missed by traditional accuracy-based metrics.

## Optimization Course Project  

**Title:** Optimization in Portfolio Management  
**Type:** Optimization course final project  
**Paper:** [`Optimization_project_final_report.pdf`](Optimization_project_final_report.pdf)  

**Summary:**  
Applies Markowitz portfolio theory and convex optimization to construct efficient portfolios under realistic constraints. Implements quadratic programming and risk–return trade-off formulations (including Sharpe-ratio–based optimization), and studies the impact of real-world constraints such as no-shorting and turnover limits.

## Experimental Design Course Project  

**Title:** How Sweet It Is to Be Naturally Brewed  
**Type:** Experimental design course final project  
**Paper:** [`experimental_design_final_project.pdf`](experimental_design_final_project.pdf)  

**Summary:**  
Designs and analyzes experiments on how coffee bean roasting levels and extraction times affect perceived sweetness and caffeine content. Uses split-plot / blocked designs, mixed-effects models, and power analysis to evaluate treatment effects and optimize naturally sweeter coffee with reduced reliance on added sweeteners.

## Cognitive Science Course Project  

**Title:** LLMs Can Feel But Not See? AI vs Human Categorical Continuous Learning  
**Type:** Cognitive science / computation & cognition course project  
**Paper:** [`Garrido-Huang-ccm-final.pdf`](Garrido-Huang-ccm-final.pdf)  

**Summary:**  
Compares human and large language model (LLM) performance on perceptual and conceptual categorization tasks. Uses controlled experiments and prototype vs exemplar-style LLM prompting to study hypothesis updating, reasoning, and category learning, connecting classic cognitive models with modern LLM behavior.
